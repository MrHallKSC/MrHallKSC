## 📚 What I Teach

**GCSE – Edexcel 1CP2 (Python)**  
I support students with structured projects, practice code, and utilities that link computational thinking to coding.

**A-level – AQA 7517 (C# & WPF)**  
I build Windows applications to illustrate:

- UI design with WPF  
- OOP principles in real projects  
- Database connections and event-driven programming

### ⭐ C#/ WPF Beginner Projects

- **[GridExemplarWPF](https://github.com/MrHallKSC/GridExemplarWPF)**  
  This WPF project renders a simple 2D grid of Square cells onto a Canvas, drawing each cell as a filled rectangle and randomly adding wall lines on the north/east/south/west edges, with selection shown by a different color. It’s a good starting point for Maze projects for AQA 7517 NEA  because it demonstrates how to keep a clear underlying data model (Square[,]) while building a visual interface on top of it for students who are new to WPF. It helps to demonstrate separating UI logic from rendering, and drawing to a canvas, but does not include any maze generating or solving algorithms, and lacks the complex OOP structure of a full project.

### ⭐ C#/WPF Whole Projects

- **[DatabaseExampleWPF](https://github.com/MrHallKSC/DatabaseExampleWPF)**  
  This is a example database project that provides a cut-down library management system that demonstrates connecting to an Sqlite database. It shows how to build a complete desktop application that stores data in a SQLite relational database, including creating tables, inserting/updating/deleting records (CRUD), and working with relationships such as one‑to‑many (Members → Loans, Books → Loans) and many‑to‑many (Books ↔ Authors). It also demonstrates core NEA‑useful skills such as parameterised SQL (to avoid SQL injection), JOIN queries (via LoanWithDetails and the loans search window), basic validation and error handling, and essential WPF patterns like event-driven programming, populating controls (DataGrid/ComboBox) from data, and updating the UI based on selections and filters. 

  
- **[SnookerWPF](https://github.com/MrHallKSC/SnookerWPF)**  
  Full snooker game demonstrating OOP, complex UI and a physics simulation with per tick updating. It helps AQA 7517 students practice core programming skills including OOP (classes like Ball, CueBall, inheritance/abstraction), algorithmic thinking (step-by-step update loop, collision detection/resolution), and data structures/iteration (working with List<Ball>, nested loops). It also builds confidence with maths in programming (vectors, angles, friction, restitution), event-driven design (the OnCueBallCollision event).

## 🧠 Teaching Philosophy

I focus on clear examples that students can explore and extend:

- Start with simple code that works  
- Add features step by step  
- Explain patterns and best practices  
- Share reusable templates for lessons
